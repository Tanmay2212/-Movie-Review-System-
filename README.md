Ever forget how much you loved (or hated) a movie?   This Python project lets you build your own personal movie rating system!
Movie Rating System with Python and a Database

This project lets you create a personal movie rating system using Python and a database. You can:

Add Movie Ratings: Enter the title of a movie you've watched and give it a rating (1 to 10). These ratings are stored in a special program called a database, like a digital filing cabinet.
View Ratings: See all the movie ratings you've added so far.
What You'll Need:

Python: A free programming language you can download from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Database: We'll use a free database program called PostgreSQL. You can find instructions on installing it at [invalid URL removed] (this might require some technical knowledge).
psycopg2: A helper program for Python to connect to the database. You can install it by typing pip install psycopg2 in your command prompt (a black window where you type commands).
How to Use It:

Get the Code: Download or copy the code for this project from GitHub.
Change the Database Settings: Open the code (usually named movie_rating_system.py) and change the information at the beginning (look for host, database, user, and password) to match your database setup. (This might require some help if you're new to databases.)
Run the Program: Open a command prompt, navigate to the folder with the code, and type python movie_rating_system.py to start.
Follow the Menu: The program will show you options like adding ratings, viewing ratings. Just choose the option you want and follow the on-screen instructions.

Things to Keep in Mind:

This project works best with a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to set one up for it to work.
This example focuses on adding and viewing ratings. You can expand it later to edit or delete them if you want.
